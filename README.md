## Quick Start

1. Fork this repo.

2. Add and customize your quiz questions (in JSON format) in `trivia-questions/questions.json`.

3. Create a new project in [Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase).

4. Add Firebase to your project (Android, iOS, and/or Web). 
    - For Android, you will need to download and copy over the `google-services.json` file to `android/app`
    - For iOS, you will need to download and copy over the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to `ios/runner`

5. Set up a Realtime Database for your project in Firebase. Copy the database URL. 

6. In `lib/MainActivity.dart`, find the following line and paste the database URL:
    ```
    final needsSnapshot = await FirebaseDatabase.instance.refFromURL("PASTE THE URL HERE/NEW_APP/LeaderBoard").get()
    ```

7. Upload the `/trivia-questions/questions.json` file to your Firebase database.

8. Go to the Google Developer Console to get a app specific `Client ID` for Google authentication

9. In `lib/MainActivity.dart`, find the following line and paste in your Client ID from the previous step:

    ```
    final GoogleSignIn googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(clientId: "PASTE THE CLIENT ID HERE");
    ```

10. Run and test the app using your Android or iOS emulator.
